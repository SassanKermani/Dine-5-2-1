It will utilize the yelp api to load a list of ~50 restaurants based on some simple criteria($$$, location), and display them to a user.
That user will reduce that list to 5 restaurants, and then their partner will get the list of 5.
The partner will reduce that list of 5 to 2, then send it to the original user.
The original user will select the restaurant they are going to.
